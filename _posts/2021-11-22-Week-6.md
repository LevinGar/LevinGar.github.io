## Pivoting Tech Stacks And Taking Challenges

In this essay, I share my week's experiences and lessons learned. This was the second week of the "Building something from scratch" phase, and my teammates and I were faced with a variety of challenges, including maintaining the commitment to complete the scope we established to deliver as a project with our first real client at Encora, despite making some radical changes to the project we began in the fifth week of the program.

One of the most important lessons I took away from this week was the need of considering all factors when selecting a technology stack for project development. Despite all of the various implicit factors that must be considered, I learned about a lot of them, and I feel that the only way to be aware of them is to work in a real employment setting and meet client demands. There's a fine line between providing the consumer with the answer they want and providing them with the greatest possible long-term solution.  
Among the most valuable lessons we've learned from this apprentice program is to focus on more than one technological stack and to build our ability to quickly learn any language by tying our understanding of the stacks to the syntax of the new language we're studying. This week was the time to put that into effect and pivot the development we had in the project's back-end to a whole new framework and language that we began to build the project with.  
Throughout the project's development, we had to be in continual contact with the customer, telling them of any changes and plans, including the stack change we made. Giving the consumer the whole context of our choice made sense, and they were pleased with it. Constant contact with the client allows you to build trust while also providing you the opportunity to get vital input on something that is unsure, preventing you from delivering work that the customer will not approve.  

In conclusion, I saw the importance of showing commitment to the customer by having a good balance of being challenging yourself to give an extra, but at the same time staying inside the scope of what is capable of bringing in the defined lapse of time.
