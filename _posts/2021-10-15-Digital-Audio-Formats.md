## Lighting Talk’s Topic Information
### What was the main improvement that allowed phones being capable of playing real songs? Of course, this is related to storage but digital audio formats had an important role on this.

When I was choosing a topic for this lighting talk, I wanted to pick something related to what we daily interact with, then mobile phones came up to my mind, and I started looking at the history of the features that have been added to phones over time, and then I remembered the big boom of the MP3 when phones were capable of reproducing real songs, and I had a question - What was the main improvement that allowed phones being capable of playing real songs? Of course, this is related to storage but digital audio formats had an important role on this.

PCM
Pulse-code modulation (PCM) is a method used to digitally represent sampled analog signals. It is the standard form of digital audio in computers, compact discs, digital telephony and other digital audio applications. In a PCM stream, the amplitude of the analog signal is sampled regularly at uniform intervals, and each sample is quantized to the nearest value within a range of digital steps.

Sampling
After sampling, the signal value is known only at discrete points in time, called sampling instants. If these points have a sufficiently close spacing, a smooth curve drawn through them allows us to interpolate intermediate values to any degree of accuracy. We can therefore say that a continuous curve can be adequately (i.e. perfectly, in theory) described by the sample values alone.

Quantizing
To transmit the sampled values via a digital system, we have to represent each sample value in numerical form. This requires quantizing where each accurate sample value is rounded off to the closest numerical value in a given numerical set.

In the quantizing process the information in accurate signal values is lost because of rounding off and the original signal cannot be reproduced exactly any more.

The more quantum levels we use, the better performance we get.

Digital audio files, unlike analog, are often compressed, using computer programs. This makes the file smaller so you can fit more songs on your listening devices. There are three varieties of audio file compression; each offers certain advantages

Lossless codecs
With lossless codecs, all the musical information that forms the basis of the audio file is preserved when the file is compressed and stored on the computer. Lossless codecs provide the highest audio fidelity, but the files they create are relatively large, which means that you can fit fewer songs on a computer hard drive or music server.
The most common lossless codecs are
* Windows Media Lossless: Part of Microsoft Windows Media Player 9 and 10, this codec is built into the Windows Media Player software and is supported by some media adapter systems. 
* Apple Lossless: Included with iTunes software, Apple’s Lossless Encoder is Apple’s competitor to Windows Media Lossless. 
* Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC): Free Lossless Audio Codec is, as its name implies, a lossless codec that’s free. A few audio players that support the FLAC codec include the Sonos Digital Music System and the Slim Devices Squeezebox. 
Lossy codecs
Lossy codecs discard some part of the musical information to make the files smaller — for faster downloads on the Internet or to cram more music on a given size of computer storage device. You probably won’t notice the difference when listening casually, but many people can hear a difference when lossy and lossless versions of the same music are played back over a high-quality home theater audio system.
Popular lossy codecs are
* MP3: MPEG-1 (Motion Picture Experts Group 1) Audio Layer 3 is the full name of the most common digital music format. MP3 audio files are the ones commonly traded (usually illegally) on the Internet, and they’re the most common digital music codec used on PCs and digital music systems in a wireless network. 
* WMA: Windows Media Audio is the standard audio format used by Windows Media Player and compatible hardware. A lossless version of WMA does exist, but most WMA files use a lossy compression system. 
* AAC: Advanced Audio Codec is the format used by Apple Computer’s iTunes Music Store and is the default codec for music encoded using the iTunes application. Like WMA, AAC files are lossy (though within Apple’s iTunes system there is a lossless codec as well, called Apple Lossless). 
* Ogg Vorbis: Another free codec is Ogg Vorbis. Ogg Vorbis is designed to be free from the licensing fees that software and hardware companies must pay for other codecs such as MP3, and also provides improved sound quality compared to other lossy codecs.

MP3
The combination of small size and acceptable fidelity led to a boom in the distribution of music over the Internet in the mid- to late-1990s, with MP3 serving as an enabling technology at a time when bandwidth and storage were still at a premium.

MQA (hi-res): A lossless compression format that packages hi-res files for more efficient streaming. Used for Tidal Masters hi-res streaming.
OGG (not hi-res): Sometimes called by its full name, Ogg Vorbis. A lossy, open-source alternative to MP3 and AAC, unrestricted by patents. The file format used (at 320kbps) in Spotify streaming. 
WAV (hi-res): The standard format in which all CDs are encoded. Great sound quality but it's uncompressed, meaning huge file sizes (especially for hi-res files). It has poor metadata support (that is, album artwork, artist and song title information).


Which is the best audio file format for you?
The file format you choose will depend on whether storage or sound quality is your key concern, as well as which devices you intend to use for playback. 
MP3s became hugely popular when storage was at a premium. Now that phones, music players and laptops have far more storage space, we think you really should be looking to use better-than-CD-quality files.
If you’re archiving your audio files, a FLAC or other lossless file might be a good idea.

Sample Rate
In digital audio recordings, sample rate is analogous to the framerate in video. The more sound data (samples) gathered per period of time, the closer to the original analog sound the captured data becomes.

Bit Depth
The bit depth determines how much information can be stored. A sampling with 24-bit depth can store more nuances and hence, more precise than a sampling with 16-bit depth.

In summary, sample rate is the number of audio samples recorded per unit of time and bit depth measures how precisely the samples were encoded. Finally, the bit rate is the amount of bits that are recorded per unit of time.

In video terminology, container format is a type of file format that contains various types of data compressed by standardized codecs. Container formats are essentially wrappers in that they don’t specify what codec the container format uses, but rather it defines how the video, audio and other data is stored within the container. Examples of container formats include IFF, WAV, AVI, Ogg and 3GP.
