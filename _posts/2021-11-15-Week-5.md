## The first week of building something from scratch.

This week was the introduction to a new phase which is "Building something from scratch" where we have to develop a project for a client. In my context, I was given a project in which there was no development, so it was necessary to plan a new project from scratch taking into consideration and negotiating the final scope of the planned development for the month the phase last in which the project is being developed.

It was necessary to create several types of UML diagrams in order to depict the connection between the many features that are intended to implement over the month in order to create the project's scope and proposal. I've worked with some UML diagrams, but there are many different types that serve different purposes, and I had to go deep into the many types of flows that UML can represent, so I learned a lot.  

This week, I've been learning a lot about communication. Because I was starting from scratch with my team, a lot of communication was required to organize the many tasks we had to do in order to produce the proposal and study the various technologies we might utilize to develop the end product the customer expected.  

It's worth noting that, at the time this article was written, we were still working entirely remotely, which presents a difficulty in that it's difficult to keep track of everything that's going on with eight different people at the same time. That is why I put all we've learned about communication and how to enhance our communication skills in order to provide a clear and concise message.  

Taking into consideration what was mentioned above, in order of keeping good communication with a group of developers, as a team, we had to define different platforms we have to use to communicate between us but also to track the different activities and tasks we are performing in order of avoiding working in the same task and loose time. I have learned a lot from the different tools we are using, and from the ones we chose not to use, since we had to analyze all of them, I got some learnings from those other tools too.  

Finally, in addition to all of the many explorations into stacks of technology, processes, and tools. Because I put a lot of what I've learned in prior weeks into practice, this week has a lot of varied learning opportunities. By practicing, I've gained a better understanding of the many tasks I've completed, allowing me to feel more confident in my current performance.
