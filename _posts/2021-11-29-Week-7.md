## Prioritizing and optimizing

This week, I noticed how the team's confidence and communication has improved, not just in our connection but also in finding a method for us to provide our best as a group. The week began with a large number of activities to do; but, by establishing particular responsibilities and experimenting with various communication methods, we were able to begin working in an efficient manner, achieving all of our week objectives.

We've discovered the value of interacting with people in the IT area throughout this time. Despite IT workers who work with machines, these are merely tools since the end product that is being built will have human functions, contrary to popular belief, there are and should be many people to person interactions. This isn't new information, but what interests me is how this Apprentice Program emphasizes it and teaches you the best techniques for maintaining a positive work atmosphere and optimizing communication to enhance internal processes when working in the IT field.

Since during this week we have migrated the backend from Python Flask to JavaScript Node with Express, I had to learn the basics of starting a node project. The good news is that we already had the planning for the developing of the back-end, so once I learned something in node I rapidly applied to the project. Express.js is great frameworks for making a node.js REST APIs however it doesn't give you any clue on how to organizing your node.js project.

Not having a path for the architecture when developing a node project makes harder learning how to start a project without experience. Your node's right organization. If done right, a js project structure will prevent duplication of code, increase stability, and potentially help you grow your services.

After reading different posts about architecture for node, some of them provided from one of my mentors I have learned these points.
src
  │   app.js          # App entry point  
  └───api             # Express route controllers for all the endpoints of   
  └───config          # Environment variables and configurations  
  └───jobs            # Jobs definitions for agenda.js  
  └───loaders         # Split the startup process into modules  
  └───models          # Database models  
  └───services        # All the business logic is here  
  └───subscribers     # Event handlers for async task  
  └───types           # Type declaration files (d.ts) for Typescript  

You could be tempted to merely use express.js controllers to hold your application's business logic, but this rapidly becomes spaghetti code, and you'll end up dealing with complicated mocks for req or res express.js objects if you need to build unit tests.

It's difficult to tell when a response should be given and when processing should continue in the background, say after the response has been provided to the client.
