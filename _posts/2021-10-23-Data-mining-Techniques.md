## Lighting Talk's Topic Information
Like how mining for gold is digging through earth and rock to find valuable bits
data mining is digging through large sets of data to find hidden valuable information and identify patterns. 

This is somethings have been evolving over time by the development of technology
Given the evolution of data warehousing and big data, adoption of data mining techniques has quickly grown over the last 20 years, helping companies to transform raw data into useful knowledge.

Steps

Business objetives
Data scientists and business stakeholders need to work together to define the business problem, which helps to define the data questions and parameters for a given project.

Data preparation
Once the scope of the problem is defined, it is easier for data scientists to identify which set of data will help answer the pertinent questions to the business. Once they collect the relevant data, the data will be cleaned, removing any noise, such as duplicates, missing values, and outliers.

Model Building
Depending on the type of analysis, data scientists may investigate any interesting data relationships, such as sequential patterns, association rules, or correlations.


Data mining includes the utilization of data analysis tools to find previously unknown patterns and relationships in huge data sets. 
These tools can incorporate statistical models, machine learning techniques, and of course mathematical algorithms, such as neural networks or decision trees. Also, data mining incorporates analysis and prediction.

Depending on various methods and technologies from the intersection of machine learning, database management, statistics, and processes and make conclusions from huge amounts of data, 
but what are the methods are used make it happen?
In recent data mining projects, various major data mining techniques have been developed and used, including association, classification, clustering, prediction, sequential patterns, regression, among others.

Classification
This data mining method is used to distinguish the items in the data sets into classes or groups. It helps to predict the behavior of entities within the group accurately. It is a two-step process:

Clustering
Clustering is almost similar to classification, but in this cluster are made depending on the similarities of data items. Different groups have unrelated objects. It is also called data segmentation as it partitions huge data sets into groups according to the similarities.

Prediction
This method is used to predict the future based on the past and present trends or data set. 		Prediction is mostly used to combine other mining methods such as classification, pattern 		matching, trend analysis, and relation.
For example, if the sales manager would like to predict the amount of revenue that each item would geneate based on past sales data. It models a continuous-valued function that indicates missing numeric data values.

Tracking patterns
One of the most basic techniques in data mining is learning to recognize patterns in your data sets. This is usually a recognition of some aberration in your data happening at regular intervals, or in a flow of a certain variable over time. 
For example, you might see that your sales of a certain product seem to spike just before the holidays, or notice that warmer weather drives more people to your website.

Anomaly Analysis
In many cases, simply recognizing the overarching pattern can’t give you a clear understanding of your data set. You also need to be able to identify anomalies, or outliers in your data. 
For example, if your purchasers are almost exclusively male, but during one strange week in July, there’s a huge spike in female purchasers, you’ll want to investigate the spike and see what drove it, so you can either replicate it or better understand your audience in the process.

These methodologies are used to identify the data that can give us valuable knowledge of what are we analyzing
