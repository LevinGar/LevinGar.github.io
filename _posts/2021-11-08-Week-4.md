## Itâ€™s all about science

One of the main learnings from this week was the scientific method which is a method for determining whether or not a hypothesis is correct. According to Richar Feymann, the method begins with guessing, then having a hypothesis about something, then we experiment to approve or disapprove our hypothesis, and finally, we analyze the results and draw a conclusion about them.

We can use this method to try to disprove any certain theory. We can get rid of any theory if we have a precise theory, a true estimate, from which we can easily compute consequences that can be compared with experiments. Any definite hypothesis may always be shown wrong; nevertheless, we can never prove it right.  

Failure is something that many people find difficult to accept in their lives, yet it is a reality that we all face in our personal and professional lives. Failure is a topic that many individuals and sectors fear discussing when something goes wrong; for many, this represents weakness. Failure is something that is better disguised depending on the job; yet, evaluating failure is the greatest approach to develop and prevent problems from happening again.

The simple idea of having a "black box" in our personal life, similar to what is used in planes, would help us realize that we are not perfect. Having this black box will remind us that things will fail since that is the nature of humans and the things we do. Analyzing our failures in great depth might help us improve in everything we're afraid about.

Accepting failure allows us to get the most out of the lessons it teaches us. We've been working on pre-prototypes this week, which we're calling "pretotypes." Alberto Savoia refers to these prototypes in this way because he believes it is best to start trying and verifying new ideas before we start working or doing something significant with them; in his video, he states, "The rule of failure, most new ideas fail," which is correct.  

I've learned through the prototypes that even if we are certain that a concept would be a hit, we don't always share the same vision as others. That is why it is a good practice to validate our ideas in such a manner that we do not have to spend a lot of time and money determining whether or not the concept is feasible. It is feasible to test a project's viability by modeling what the final result will look like and confirming whether it will attract attention as desired.  

If we want anything to happen, we should be innovators who act on their ideas rather than merely thinking about them.
Pretotyping is beneficial to innovators because it is a quick and easy approach to demonstrate that there are individuals interested in adopting the concept. 

Something is related to learning from failures is testing. Testing is a technique to ensure a system's quality, and there are several methods for doing so. This does not mean that one method will totally replace another; all are helpful, and it will depend on the specific needs.  

I learned that companies use a variety of techniques from the several videos regarding testing that were shown. Additionally, Google assists engineers in improving their testing experience, allowing them to test faster and more efficiently both manually and automatically.  

One of the main purposes of testing is prevention, despite there is testing in different phases, it is intended to be done before or during implementation. A very interesting approach of how testing could be implemented is the way Netflix created the simian army and Failure Injection Testing, techniques that accelerate the manifestation of future errors. I found this technique very useful because in that way you can confront bugs and inevitable failures by intentionally provoking them in a safe environment.

In conclusion, during this week we have learned more about how to take advantage of failure, a thing that is inevitable and that is in some way ok to happen. By applying methodologies like the scientific method it is possible to minimize the bad effect of failing and learning from it so we can make some improvements in what we are working on.
