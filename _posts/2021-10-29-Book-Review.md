## Code. The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software
The following content is a review of the book "Code. The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software" where I give my personal opinion, learnings, and how this book was relevant to me. Additionally, I bring some sketches and bullet points about the most relevant parts of the book, and the main learnings I got from it.

I've always been curious about how computers own intelligence since I was a child. I used to imagine that a computer had some internal mechanics, similar to a motor; however, as a university student studying Information Technologies, I understood how a computer's hardware worked, but because my career was more focused on software, I did not fully understand how software and hardware communicated with one another.
It is crucial to know how to deal with the most recent technologies, I used to believe, and now I know what was wrong, that understanding how a piece of hardware works internally is unnecessary if you want to focus on productivity when developing, which it is not. I've always had gaps in my understanding of how my main tool for working and learning works, but after reading this book, I have a much better understanding of how hardware and software interact, that is why I would recommend it.

Nowadays, when someone learns to code for the first time, it is typical to do so on a new computer. The younger the new coder, the less familiar he or she will be with how the computer works inside, and how much the internal components have evolved over time. Even if they grasp the hardware requirements, once they're using an operating system, they have no idea what's going on inside, what's actually going on when you type, how electrons move within the various components, and what transistors say when they're holding charges. In a word, this book tells you everything you need to know about this, and I consider every programmer should know and find it very interesting.
Besides the explanation of how hardware and software interact, this book explains how other topics regarding information, it is shown the many different ways of bringing information a single bit can give. Information goes beyond only binary language, binary is just the machine language, but many complex things can be encoded into it.
The goal of the book is to educate a wide audience about how computers function. Gradually progressing over time.

Starting with binary data representation using morse code, it progresses through non-base-10 number systems, telegraphs, electromagnets, and the creation of the relay, a flip-flop switch that permits temporary storage of a single bit. All of this leads to a fantastic chapter in which you utilize this technology to create a complete working computer in your mind's eye.
You can understand this book if you can do basic math. That seems to be the idea. That computers are simple and should be simple to understand. Though I'm sure some people will think this isn't detailed enough. But the idea is that knowing extensively will give you lots a variety of entrances into programming and computer science. It will clarify a lot of things and make the route look less terrifying and out of reach. This book does a fantastic job at it. High-level programmers will feel less unsecure about their lack of understanding of the underlying principles of whatever they're working on.
