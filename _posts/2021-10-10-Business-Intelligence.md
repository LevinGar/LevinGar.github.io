## Lighting Talk’s Topic Information

What is Business Intelligence? 
* Originally emerged in the 1960s as a system of sharing information across organizations. 
* In the 1980s It further developed alongside computer models for decision-making and turning data into insights 
* Modern BI solutions prioritize flexible self-service analysis, governed data on trusted platforms, empowered business users, and speed to insight.
* Much more than a specific “thing,” business intelligence is rather an umbrella term that covers the processes and methods of collecting, storing, and analyzing data from business operations or activities to optimize performance. 

A data silo is a collection of data held by one group that is not easily or fully accessible by other groups in the same organization. Finance, administration, HR, marketing teams, and other departments need different information to do their work. Those different departments tend to store their data in separate locations known as data or information silos

Data warehouse
A data warehouse is a central repository of information that can be analyzed to make more informed decisions. Data flows into a data warehouse from transactional systems, relational databases, and other sources, typically on a regular cadence. 

Business analysts, data engineers, data scientists, and decision makers access the data through business intelligence (BI) tools, SQL clients, and other analytics applications.

Applies your business logic to your centralized data. This creates a single source of truth that can be relied on by all departments.

KPIs
* KPIs provide targets for teams to shoot for, milestones to gauge progress, and insights that help people across the organization make better decisions. 


Instead of analysts manually compiling spreadsheets, modern BI platforms can access, analyze, display, and share data via web-based dashboards. With a powerful, automated business intelligence tool, stakeholders can build dashboards to review, draw conclusions, and act.

Dashboards and reports can work together to give a comprehensive view of trends and insights, but they are different. Dashboards can be updated in near-real time using cloud-based technology. They tend to be visual and interactive, allowing the user to engage with the information and create their own analyses. Reports, on the other hand, are static—they offer detail, but the end user must extract insights from a compilation of data.
