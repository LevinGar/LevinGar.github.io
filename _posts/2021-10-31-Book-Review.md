## The Passionate Programmer Review  
The following content is a review of the book “The Passionate Programmer” where I give my personal opinion, learnings, and I show using bullet points the main learnings I got from this book while reading it.

While reading this book, I discovered that it contains a variety of life and professional lessons that can be applied not only in the IT field but also in other fields. The majority of the examples it provides are based on Char Fowler's personal experiences in the IT field, but those experiences are about achieving our goals in life, how to interact with others, how to adapt to a changing environment, and most importantly, how to forge your own path, at least for me.

Regarding this apprentice program, I realize that there were many things in the book that have been mentioned and taken into action during this program, such as, the importance of taking responsibility, the communication with others, the fact that there is no one specific technology you should focus on, the importance of having a mentor and how to interact with them, among others things.

This book is full of phrases that give you lessons in small sentences, while reading the book, I was originally taking notes of these little parts of the book, in order of using them to later write a review about this book, nevertheless, these phrases and notes I took are self-explanatory and it is not necessary to them to relate with other things to understand and have a lesson from them, that is why you will find above a big list of bullet points of the different stuff I found worth it to remember, analyze in your context, and learn from it.  

### Choosing your market
- As demand grows, so does price competition, and you'll have to compete at a greater level to compete in the mainstream technology industry.
- Recognizing that you aren't the best eliminates the fear of being found as the not-best person you are.
- Even if you try your best to be the worst, you won't succeed.
- If you are passionate about what you do, you will invest in your intellect. You will get deeper, better, sharper, and more creative if you are passionate about your work.
- Take prudent risks in your professional life. Don't allow fear to take over your life. And you're not going to be excellent if you're not having fun.
- The best way to become a generalist is to avoid identifying yourself with a particular function or technology. 
- In many respects, we might become typecast in our professions. Too many of us appear to feel that focusing on one area simply implies a lack of knowledge in other areas.
- Being a specialist requires a deep understanding of all technologies that surround the one on which you've decided to focus. If you want to excel in your job, you must be enthusiastic about it. If you don't care, it will show.
- By choosing job that we are passionate about, we can all take a giant step away from mediocrity.  

### Investing in your product
- Education necessitates the presence of both a teacher and a learner. Many of us are afraid to be students all of the time.
- Don't wait for someone to tell you. Ask!
- You won't know every single company rule since that isn't your job. However, you can at least grasp the fundamentals.
- It is important to make an informed decision about the business domain in which you operate. You can't help a company creatively until you understand how it operates.
- Understanding your company's financial drivers—and language—will enable you to make major changes rather than shoot in the dark at things that seem intuitively correct.
- It's fine to rely on others. Just double-check that it's the right person.
- In the traditional professional world (and particularly in the IT industry), we're less likely to seek help from one another. Having to depend on others is generally considered a sign of weakness.
- We don't want to accept we're not perfect. Everything centers on the competition. Only the strong will survive, and such. Unfortunately, this results in a mentoring structure that is clearly lacking.
- A mentor can also act as a trusted third party who can evaluate your actions and progress. You can show them your code and get tips if you're a coder.
- What matters is that you have someone you respect and trust who can offer career advice and assist you in developing your trade.
- To find out whether you really know something, try teaching it to someone else.
- You don’t have to set up a formal mentoring relationship to get these benefits. Just start helping people, and the rest will come naturally.
- In the computer industry, it’s common to find developers stretched to their limits. Unfortunately, this is usually a case of a developer being under-qualified for the tasks that he or she has undertaken.
- The important thing is to find your practice needs and to make sure you’re not practicing during your performances (on the job). You have to make time for practice. It’s your responsibility.
- While managers intuitively understand that they must follow some sort of procedure, they are often uninformed of the options that are currently accessible. As a result, they are resurrecting the same procedures that were forced upon them in the 1980s.
- Help in the implementation of a process if you want to feel like you own it. If you don't have a process in place, look at methodologies that might work for you. Have brown-bag lunches with your team to talk about current development issues and how a consistent approach could help you solve them.
- Make use of existing programs to assess your own abilities. The traditional IT management response is to hire more programmers to speed things up. It's incorrect, yet it's what most people believe.  

### Executing
- Whenever you add code to a system, you run the risk of making it less adaptable to change. Avoid mind-reading tasks that could compel the system along a specific architectural path or limit its capabilities in some way.
- You might decide to tweak a feature that your consumers have requested in a way that, unintentionally to you, makes it less functional or appealing to them. When it comes to user interfaces, be wary about guessing.
- If the manager's duty is to know and set priorities but not to perform all of the work personally, then your job is to do all of the work. You are not doing the manager's duties on his or her behalf. You're doing an excellent job.
- Be where you are at
- The work we love lets us flex our creative muscles. Software development is a creative act, and many of us are drawn to it for this reason.
- Ask, “Was I worth it today?”
- Maintenance can be a place of freedom and creativity.
- Projects are marathons, not sprints
- Keep track of your working hours. You'll get more done if you work less. When you've taken some time away from work, it's always more enjoyable.
- Unit testing helps us in identifying unusual bugs as early as possible. We are thrilled when we discover strange problems in our own code, especially if they occur early.
- Our small failures tell us what kind of failures to expect in the future.
- Every incorrect note is only one step further from being correct.
- Raise the issue as early as you know about it. Don’t try to hide it for any length of time.
- Assume responsibility. Even if you find a good scapegoat, don't try to find one.
- Provide a solution. If you don't have one, propose a strategy for resolving the problem.
- Seek assistance. Even if you are fully to blame for a problem, don't let your pride get in the way of a solution by refusing to help.
- The finest times to create loyalty are when things are stressful. Never committing to anything is the simplest way to never get anything done. When you don't have a deadline, you don't feel obligated or motivated to complete a task.  

### Marketing... Not Just for Suits
- Perceptions are really important. They keep you working (or unemployed). They might help you advance in your career or keep you in the same position for years.
- Your task is to take your consumer on a tour of the information technology world's treacherous terrain.
- Writing skills are considered by more than half of all responding organizations when making recruiting and promotion choices.
- You are only as good as your ability to express yourself.
- Promote your accomplishments in your company's language.
- Set a goal for yourself. Make sure that everyone is aware of it.
- There is no objective framework for evaluating and hiring software developers. Being a decent person is crucial, but it won't go you very far.
- There are two components to developing a brand: making a mark that people will identify and then ensuring that the mark is connected with desirable attributes. Respect and acknowledgment.
- Be careful where you let your name show up. Don’t do lousy projects or send lousy e-mails to large groups of people (or make lousy weblog posts for the whole Internet to read). Don’t be a jerk. Nobody likes a jerk, even if they somehow deserve to be a jerk.
- * While many of these developers are simply having a good time and expressing themselves, there are some actual incentives in place. They're working their way up a community's social ladder. They're trying to make a name for themselves.  

### Maintaining Your Edge
- Today’s hot new item is tomorrow’s obsolete junk with a limited shelf life.
- * Because timing is crucial, begin planning ahead with your studies. What will be achievable in the next two years that isn't now?
- Being visionary or blind can be determined by looking forward and being explicit about your skill improvement.
- Businesses are trying to adapt to the changing environment.
- Concentrate on doing rather than being done.
- Promotions and salary increases aren't the most important aspects of your job. It's the time you devote to making such advancements. Or, more importantly, it's the amount of time you spend working regardless of progress.
- Be cautious of monkey traps, whether they're in your professional path or the technology you promote and invest in. Those initially deliberate choices may end up being the last handful of rice you hold before your career is smashed to bits.
- The larger and more complicated a project is, the more difficult it is to picture each feature in sufficient depth to write a specification.
- Becoming an independent contractor force you to learn how to sell yourself while also putting your domain and technology choices to the test.
