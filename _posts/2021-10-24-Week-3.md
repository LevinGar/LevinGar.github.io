## Fancy Topics

During this week we were given a variety of materials to work with, including inspiring and inventive topics that demonstrated what we can do (In general). The quantum computer topics remind me of the early days of modern computers when there was no foundation for computing at all, and everything was simply concepts that were applied and brought to life. Everything nowadays feels like a remix, but there are a lot of things we haven't done yet, and a lot of things we can improve on in order to accomplish unthinkable things like the quantum computing revolution appears to be capable of.  
Personally, the readings were more relevant for me in my technical formation this time since they assisted me in answering issues I had prior to the readings, such as testing, git, and a different perspective on vim.  

One of the things I enjoyed the most was cooperating with other apprentices, since we have been given team assignments, it has been very interesting and fun to work with them. Since we are working remotely, and we are over 20 apprentices, I thought defining a framework to work together would be something challenging, but it was actually not, we were working well since the beginning, cooperatively, and friendly.  

Something I found great about working with other apprentices is the way we share knowledge. During this week, we discussed our successes and mistakes, which is something that isn't seen very often. The fact that we have been discussing our failures demonstrates a high level of trust and collaboration, which I admire.  

Aside from the content we were provided, I got the chance to learn about Encora's workflow and personal experiences from my mentors, as well as an overview of the technology they use, how to improve my lighting talks, and I began to study React.
In addition, I've been looking into certain subjects I think I need to know more about and reviewing some things I thought I knew well previously, such as technical terminology, OOP theory, and programming best practices principles, to name few of.  

### Moonshot Thinking from Astro Teller
Moonshot Thinking may be explained as the method of identifying a major issue, such as climate change, and proposing a radical solution to the problem utilizing disruptive technologies. To make this happen, you must abandon the concept of making a 10% incremental improvement and instead focus on a solution that will provide ten times (x10) improvements or totally solve the problem.  

### Quantum Computers Explained – Limits of Human Technology
I learned about quantum computers through this short video, and unlike what I had assumed, the possibilities of what quantum computers may accomplish are yet unknown. What is occurring today with this type of computer is quite similar to how things were when we first had computers; improvements were in the works, but it was uncertain what will be the use of future devices, just as it is now with quantum computers.
There are some ideas of different applications it could have nowadays, but it is well known that yet unknown things are going to happen with the development of these machines.  

### Google and NASA's Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab
This short video provides a fast and artistic overview of all quantum physics and quantum computers, including several distinct definitions, a demonstration of a genuine quantum computer, and a discussion of the various enigmatic possibilities of where this science may lead us.
It appears that we may achieve time travel and travel from one world to another by using Quantum Mechanics, and quantum computers are the first step toward a future in which all sci-fi occurrences become common. As is the case with today's AI.  

### Dr. Quantum Double Slit Experiment  
The way they explained the part when you try to see which slit the electron passes through is an error in the video. It was meant to sound more mysterious than it is.
What we should first determine is what it means to observe an electron. What does it mean to be aware of something? We require light in order to look at something. We see things because light reflects off of objects and our eyes gather it, which our brains then interpret.
In the end, I consider it is a good video because it explains something that is very complex in a very simple way.  

### Measure for Measure: Quantum Physics and Reality

### What Popularizers of Quantum Mechanics Don’t Want You to Know by Ron Garret
Besides the fact that there are things that are skipped when talking about Quantum Mechanics, my main learning from this video is that the law of conservation of strangeness governs quantum physics. And, to some extent, this is correct. There is some – quantum physics takes a toll on your intuition, and part of it will never go away.
There is a cosmos out there, and when we measure it, we are obtaining real data about the underlying physical reality. And it is for this reason that these measures are constant since reality demands them. Well, it turns out that we can show that this isn't the case.  

### Test-Driven Development
The concept I got of Test-Driven from this reading is that while the idea of having test elaboration come before programming isn't new to the Agile community, TDD is innovative in that it combines it with the concept of "developer testing," giving developer testing a fresh start.
Additionally, I learned that the regression problem is a challenge with testing, where you must provide tests that cover the requirements and features of your product, so you have moved (regressed) the problem of (potential) defects in the development into a problem with (potential) defects in the test code.	

### Unit-test by Martin Fowler
Personally, this is a topic I was very curious about, and this reading helped me to understand some things about unit testing and the inconsistencies of some things that I have heard and read about this topic. These are the things I considered more important from this reading according to Fowler:
The term "Unit test" could be very ambiguous.
Despite the differences, there are certain characteristics that are universal. For starters, unit tests are thought to be low-level, focused on a tiny portion of the software system.
Unit tests are typically created by programmers themselves using their usual tools these days, with the exception of the usage of a unit testing framework.  
Unit testing should be considerably faster than other types of tests.
One distinction is what defines a unit test. A single function may be considered a unit in procedural or functional methods, but object-oriented design treats a class as the unit. But it's actually a situational thing: the team chooses what constitutes a unit for the purposes of understanding and testing the system.  
You may not be able to execute all of the unit tests if you run them often. In most cases, you only need to run the tests that apply to the section of code you're now working on. You trade off the level of testing with the time it takes to execute the test suite, as is usual.  

### XUnit by Martin Fowler  
Despite the content of this reading, I did some additional research because of the fact that I found this very useful and I wanted to see what is the usage it has nowadays, and I found that xUnit is the umbrella term for a number of unit testing frameworks that use Smalltalk's SUnit for structure and functionality. Kent Beck created SUnit, and it was written in a highly organized object-oriented approach that worked well with modern languages like Java and C#. 

### Mocks Aren't Stubs
From this reading, I learned a little bit from different styles of testing and different tools used in Java and .NET, the one that caught my attention was EasyMock because its scope in different languages that can be used by .NET.

### La mejor presentacion de tu vida
In this video, it is mentioned that you must first focus on yourself in order to communicate your feelings to your audience and that you must also make others think and feel what you require.
Also, once you add one new item to enhance, it will be the best presentation of your life; add two, and it will be the finest presentation of your life again, and so on indefinitely.

### Videos from Bret Victor
The future of programming & Inventing on Principle
One of the videos stated that in order to look at the future of programming, it is essential to look at the foundation of programming itself, rather than at present programming. In this way, based on that assumption, it is feasible to build a different sort of technology than what we now have.
If programmers are not introduced to the fundamental concepts of programming, they will be unable to appreciate how far programming has progressed over time.

### Missing Semester
There are different software for version control, and git is the most used, that is why I consider it important to know at least the basics.
These are the commands of Git that were new for me.
git config: Git is highly customizable
git clone --depth=1: shallow clone, without entire version history
git add -p: interactive staging
git rebase -i: interactive rebasing
git blame: show who last edited which line
git stash: temporarily remove modifications to working directory
git bisect: binary search history (e.g. for regressions)
.gitignore: specify intentionally untracked files to ignore
git commit --amend: edit a commit’s contents/message
git reset HEAD <file>: unstage a file
git checkout -- <file>: discard changes
Before reading about VIM I had heard about it, I knew that it was a UIless editor, but I had not understood the philosophy behind it, and how it could be useful. Vim is a modal editor, which mainly contains different modes for inserting and modifying text. Vim's interface is a programming language in and of itself: keystrokes are commands, and these commands are composable (with Vimscript and other languages like Python). Vim does not utilize the mouse because it is too slow, and it also does not use the arrow keys since it takes too much movement.

### Carl Sagan's Pale Blue Dot 
Personally, this was a video that I enjoyed, mainly because of the narrator, the legendary Carl Sagan, this video gives a sight of how simple the chaos we see could be, compared to the majesty of the complex universe. I didn't learn something new from this video, but the sight it gives was really refreshing for me.
