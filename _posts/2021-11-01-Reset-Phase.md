## Month 1
This essay will provide an overview of the many personal learnings I gained through the program's first phase. One month's worth of lessons synthesized in a concise and comprehensive manner.

If I have to describe this phase which covered the first month of the program using just one word, that word would be "reset", just as the name this phase has. Besides all the new things I have learned, I think the most significant thing about this month for me was the fact that I changed in mind on certain things. What I mean by this, is that during this phase I received lessons that taught me things about my beliefs and myself that I thought were correct but it actually were not. That is why the word reset describes perfectly what I have experienced from this month.

During this program, we received content about habits and techniques to learn better, which I found very useful because of the fact that since the beginning of the program I felt comfortable opening my mind to trying techniques I have never done before to see if they match with me or not. In the end, I changed various techniques and habits that I found very useful and let me had a big improvement in my productivity and data retention.

Additionally to learnings regarding habits and self-discipline, I have learned and reviewed technical stuff from technical material that was provided. Many of these learnings were acquired from the lighting talks that I gave (In which I had to study properly to know well about the topic) and the ones that were presented by the rest of the apprentices. These Lighting talks were very useful to us because of the honest feedback we received from the staff and mentors, each presentation was an opportunity to improve the way we talk and introduce topics in front of others.

From Google's code-jam I saw the importance of knowing the base of programming and how it allows you to bring solutions through programming using any language, in the end, solutions are algorithms that could be implemented almost in the same way in the different programming languages out there but with a different syntax. The challenge of completing the code jam in 6 different languages was a great opportunity to learn syntax and data structures of other languages I have not worked on, and principally to deliver our first team assignment where we had to have very good communication and follow a system we agreed to organize the status of the different deliveries we had to upload.

I have learned from this phase the importance of the interaction we have with people in the IT field. Contrary to what many people think about professionals in the IT areas, there are and should be many people to person interactions, despite IT professionals working with machines, these are only tools since the final product that is being developed is going to have human purposes. This mentioned is not something new, but the relevant thing for me is the way this Apprentice Program focuses on that and teaches you the best practices to maintain a good environment and to optimize communication to improve the internal processes when working in an IT area.  

### Learning How to Learn  
During the reset phase, I completed a course in which I learned many things that could be applied to anything, information that let you understand how your brain works, how it seems sometimes that it does the opposite you want it to do, and how to deal with it when you want to learn or excel on something. The best thing about this course is that it is very useful in any field you want to excel in, does not matter if is art or tech-related, the different material provided by this course gives you a base on the things you should know to constantly improve in whatever you do.

In the beginning, it is shown how our brain works in two different modes which are focused and diffused modes, how your brain switches into these different modes, and most importantly, how to take advantage of these when learning something new. I learned that when you stop working hard by taking a walk, a nap, or just doing something that helps you to rest, it is ok, and you should not feel bad about it, because you are diffusing your mind which is beneficial. That is why is pretty common to find the solution to a bug you are working on when showering.

Procrastination and how to combat it was a topic that was introduced during the course. This part was great for me because I discovered the Pomodoro technique which helps you to stay focused on something you might be struggling with to stay working comfortably on it. It is a very simple technique in which the only thing you have to do is to set a timer with 25 minutes where you force yourself on working but also you have 5 minutes where you can diffuse your mind by relaxing or doing a non-related thing. I complimented this technique by using an application recommended by one friend of the apprentice, the app is called Forest, it helps you to implement this technique by motivating you with some dynamics the applications have.

One very useful concept the course talks about is chunks that basically are multiple neurons firing together and this helps the brain to work more efficiently by first grasping an understanding of a major concept and then figuring out where to use it. Chunking is a technique that I have used before to learn languages, but I did not know that it applies to learning anything.

Something I became more aware of my learning from this course is that almost anything could become a habit, even bad habits as procrastination is. The things you have done enough it’s become a habit. It’s the same with getting dressed or brushing your teeth. These things you can do on autopilot.

From this course, I have learned many other things such as understanding how my memory works better, identifying when I have to rest, when I am really learning rather than trying it, identifying what I have in my "working memory" and how to free it by writing short term tasks and stuff I have to do among other things.

### Books  
A considerable part of the learnings I had during this phase comes from the books I have read, you will find reviews of these books and the learnings I got from them. You can find them by navigating the main page of this blog, or by accessing the following links.
