### About me

I am a recent graduate of Information Technologies from Chihuahua, Mexico, and I have work experience in tourism and web development. Some of my favorite hobbies are outdoor activities such as MTB, off-roading, and camping. I have a passion for learning about technology and different cultures, and I love to learn and work with others.
